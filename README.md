# 1-1-AI-Research-Mentorship
I work on Autonomous Vehicle crash, predicting severities and giving insights about dangerous road and environmental conditions.
I show all my code here, it was written in Python. I also include the turtle notebook to learn Python as a crash course, which I really like although I'd known Python before. It's from the InspiritAI mentorship program that provide me.
